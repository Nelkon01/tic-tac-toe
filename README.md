    -   ### Typography
    The font used in the for the header is the [IM Fell English](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IM+Fell+English) with Sans Serif as the fall back font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly or browser compatibility issues. I think the font is also fits in nicelyb with the design of the webgame.
        
    -   ### Imagery
      Imagery is important. the game uses a background image on the game page which goes nicely with the theme and important parts of the game. The images used in the modals to give users any messages are also fit for the whatever message is being passed.

### Further Testing



### Bugs

- Encountered bugs when trying to implement a functionality that will change the color of winning cells player mark when win condition has been bet. It wasn't displaying the chosen color at first, and retained the winning color class after reset bnutton had been clicked. 
- FIX: Updated the checkwin function in javascript to store the cells into an array, and then added a highlight cells function to add the winning class styling to the winning cells array.
