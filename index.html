          <ul>
            <li>The game is played on a 3x3 board grid.</li>
            <li>
              Player 1 is X, and Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their
              marks in empty squares.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down,
              across, or diagonally) wins.
            </li>
            <li>
              If all 9 squares are full and no player has won, the game ends in
              a tie.
            </li>
