    <h2>How to Play tic- tac - toe</h2>
    <p>The game is played on a board grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</p>
    <p>Player 1 is X, and Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</p>
    <p> The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</p>
    <p> When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</p>
